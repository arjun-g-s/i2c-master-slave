<h1>ESP32 I2C Sensor Master-Slave System</h1>
This repository contains the code for a master-slave I2C system using an ESP32 as the master and an Arduino as the slave. The system reads data from multiple sensors—ultrasonic, IR, and contact sensors—and communicates the readings over I2C to the master, which outputs the data via Serial (e.g., for use in ROS or other applications).
